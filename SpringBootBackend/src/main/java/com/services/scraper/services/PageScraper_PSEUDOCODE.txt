General Notes:
    Goal:
        - get all events listed on the page and store them in DB if not already there
        - service should be called in intervals

    Event Data Needed:
        - building and room# (if applicable), start & end time, title, description, club name (if applicable)

    Web Page:
        - all events located under <u class="lw lw_event_list">
        - event titles and calendar links are under:
            <li class="lw lw_event_item">
                <div class="lw_event_item_title">
                    <div class="lw_event_item_title">
                        <a href=""> title </a>

PageItem:
    FIELDS:
        String title
        String url
    
    GETTERS/SETTERS

PageScraperService: (this could be more efficient if we knew which page items were newly added or just updated)
    - store all event titles and calendar urls
        - could be hashmap variable if titles are all unique
        - iterate through each title on website and check if exists in event table
    - must be have access to location, appointment, club, and event entities
        - creates an appointment instance
        - creates a location instance
        - find the associated club if applicable

    FIELDS:
        HashSet<PageItem> pageItems;

    METHODS:
        *Helper*
        scrapePageItems()
            iterate over page items
                gets title
                checks if event title already in database and skips if yes
                get url
                add object to pageItems

        *Helper*
        didPageUpdate()
            (check if events page got updated)
            (return boolean)

        getNewEvents()
            (call didPageUpdate() method and execute the following if returned true)
                (call scrapePageItems())
                (using pageItems, get all event information from each url, store as Event type, append to list, return list)
                    (how can we store a location, event, and appointment all together)
                (problems/special cases: location data, appointment data, or some event data does not exist on the web page)

PageScraperController:
    FIELDS:
        locationService
        appointmentService
        eventService
        pageScraperService

    METHODs:
        checkForEvents()
            call getNewEvents() and store in List of Events
            for each event in list
                post location, flush
                post appointment, flush
                post event, flush
