Goal:
    - get all events listed on the page and store them in DB if not already there
    - service should be called in intervals

Event Data Needed:
    - building and room# (if applicable), start & end time, title, description, club name (if applicable)

Web Page:
    - all events located under <u class="lw lw_event_list">
    - event titles and calendar links are under:
        <li class="lw lw_event_item">
            <div class="lw_event_item_title">
                <div class="lw_event_item_title">
                    <a href=""> {title} </a>

PageItem:
    VARIABLES:
        String title
        String url
    
    GETTERS/SETTERS

PageScraperService: (this could be more efficient if we knew which page items were newly added or just updated)
    - store all event titles and calendar urls
        - could be hashmap variable if titles are all unique
        - iterate through each title on website and check if exists in event table

    VARIABLES:
        HashSet<PageItem> pageItems;

    METHODS:
        scrapePageItems()
            iterate over page items
                gets title
                checks if event title already in database and skips if yes
                get url
                add object to pageItems

        getNewEvents()
            (using pageItems, get all event information from each url, store as Event type, append to list, return list)
            (problems/special cases: location data, appointment data, or some event data does not exist on the web page)
